Requirements for testing: 
Verify It can receive / send / read messages 
â€”> theoretically it can send any string 
Dynamically send messages (?) comes with send 


Tests: 
1. Sending messages - default response 
2. Send message - read messages and then echo response


For the time being, tests will unfortunately have to be run by hand.
The following is a template for the 'by hand' test:

enter: ./a.out &
enter: telnet localhost 9991
enter: *string to send*
expect: The message was: *string to send*
expect: This is a response
enter: QUIT
expect: Connection closed by foreign host.
expect: [1]+  Done                    ./a.out
